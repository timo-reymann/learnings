Google Technical Writing Two
===

The webinar consisted of two parts:

- pre class self-learning
- classroom session

My notes combine both parts into key areas.

## Organizing larger documents

- Split large documents info focus areas
    - How to Guides
    - Overview pages
    - Conceptual pages


- Combine multiple documentations into a reference page. Especially when the target audience are engineers that are
  already familiar
  with the product or service and just need a quick reference.

## Outline for documents

- Always start with an outline in large documents


- Get feedback on the outline from crew before starting to write the document
    - Ensure it covers the needs of the audience


- Verify the written document against the outline after finishing the document
    - Ensures that the document is not missing any key points
    - Ensures that the document is not going off track

## Introduction for documents

- Always start with an introduction


- Should answer the following questions:
    - What is the document about?
    - What does it cover?
    - What does it not cover?
    - What knowledge is required to understand the document?

## Navigation

- Provide instruction and summary sections
- Maintain a clear heading structure, always use appropriate heading levels
- Link to related documents and resources, also externally
- Add a "What to learn next?" at the bottom of the document

## Headings

- Prefer task-based structure instead of a technology or feature-based one
    - "How to create a token" instead of "Create a token with frumbus"
- Break up large tasks in smaller subtasks

## Illustrations

- Create the caption before working on the illustration
- Avoid creating illustrations that can't be explained with more than 5 bullet points
- Drill down with illustrations, don't try to explain everything in one illustration
- Make sure accessibility is given for all illustrations
    - Alt text for images
    - Textual description for complex illustrations
    - Use of colorblind friendly colors
- Arrows should always be used to indicate a flow, only pointing in one direction

## Sample code

- Should be complete and working
- Comments should only be added for non-obvious parts

## Creating good drafts

- Always start with a draft


- Create headings for the document first, before filling in the content
  - Ensures that the document is structured
  - Ensures that the document is not missing any key points


- Work on drafts in the following cycle:
    - **Reorganize**: Move headings and sections around
    - **Revise**: Check for consistency and completeness
    - **Remember**: Check for negative spaces
        - Avoid unnecessary repetition and jargon that is not needed
        - Avoid over-explaning simple concepts
        - Avoid explaining implicit information that examples could cover
