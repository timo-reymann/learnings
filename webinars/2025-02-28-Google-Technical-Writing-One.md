Google Technical Writing One
===

The webinar consisted of two parts:

- pre class self-learning
- classroom session

My notes combine both parts into key areas.

## Abbrevations (short abbrev)

- Don’t switch to abbrev mid text, when not mentioned earlier on.
- First time introduce abbrev use `long term (abbrev)`.
- Use only when multiple occurences are expected.
- Don’t cycle too much between abbrev and long form.

## Pronouns

- Avoid pronouns when possible.
- Not more than 5 words between pronoun and rest of the sentence.
- It/They is considered mostly bad.

## Active voice

- Always put everything active where ever possible.
- Actor should always be present in sentences.
- Sentences should be in form `actor + verb`

## Strong verbs

- Avoid forms of be, occur and happen.
- Avoid There is / There are.
- Avoid adjectives to make it not sound like marketing.

## Strong sentence to list

- Or / and can also be list for two elements.
- Deduplicate information in sentences.

## Replace extra words

- Less words are usually more precise
- Rephrase is `able to` to `can` where possible

## Reduce extending sentences

- One sentence should always only represent one idea

## That / Which

- that = no break, unnecessary
- which = break, necessary

## Lists / Tables

- Keep them parallel (similar item structure).
- Numbered lists start with imperative.
- Sentences end with dot.
- Alway start with upper case.
- Always introduce the content first.
- List items that are multiple lines long should be surrounded by whitespace, not connected to the other list elements.

## Paragraphs

- First sentence of paragraph should be a good intro
- Three to five sentences are ideal.
- What, why and how should be answered.

## Audience

- Determine base line of people that will read it.
- Add what they will learn to the intro.
- Avoid cultural references.
- Avoid falling for the curse of knowledge, thinking the audience knows everything the author knows.

## Documents

- State audience in the beginning.
- State scope in the beginning.
- Readers usually follow an F pattern.

## Commas

- Use oxford comma for embedded lists.
- Use semicolons to group highly related thoughts
- Use em dash for rich pauses

## Talks / Presentations

- Avoid using acronyms while talking.
